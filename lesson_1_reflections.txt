How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git: 
    advantages: you can choose when to create a commit and write the reason, so all 
    the version can be useful.
    disadvantages: you may make some mistake if you commit yourself.

    Google docs:
    advantages: It can having versions automatically saved, so it won't make mistakes.
    disadvantages: There may be many unuseful versions if it automatically saved. 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git是自己 commit 的，故可以选择每次提交多个文件，提交的文件中可以有一些关联关系，
    而Google Docs是自动保存的，会按照规则自动保存文件，不会看是否做了更改，或者文件之间有没有什么关联关系。

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    先使用git log 查看commit的历史记录，再用git diff对比不同版本的差异

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    通过版本控制，可以checkout以前的版本，通过运行，可以知道是否存在bug，通过git diff来对比有问题的版本和没有问题的版本，就可以知道造成问题的原因

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    使用tab自动补全的功能。
